{\ttfamily epiworld} is a fast and flexible agent-\/based modeling (ABM) framework for epidemiological simulations. Designed in C++, it can simulate large populations with complex interactions. The framework is designed to be modular, allowing users to extend and modify the model to suit their needs quickly. Besides the C++ library, an R package (\href{https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/epiworldR}{\texttt{ epiworldR}}), a Shiny\+App (\href{https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/epiworldRShiny}{\texttt{ epiworld\+RShiny}}), and a Python library (\href{https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/epiworldpy}{\texttt{ epiworldpy}}) are available to interact with the model.\hypertarget{md_paper_paper_autotoc_md27}{}\doxysection{Features}\label{md_paper_paper_autotoc_md27}
{\bfseries{Header-\/only}}\+: epiworld is a header-\/only template library, making it easy to integrate into existing projects. It is distributed as a collection of files and as \href{https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/epiworld/blob/master/epiworld.hpp}{\texttt{ a single header file}}.

{\bfseries{A framework}}\+: epiworld is designed to be a flexible framework for building epidemiological simulations. It provides a set of core components that can be easily extended and modified to suit the user’s needs.

{\bfseries{Fast}}\+: epiworld is designed for speed. It is implemented in C++ and uses efficient data structures and algorithms to ensure simulations dash. Furthermore, epiworld is designed to take advantage of multi-\/core processors, allowing simulations to be run in parallel (see the \href{\#speed-benchmark}{\texttt{ benchmark section}} for more details).

{\bfseries{Complex disease dynamics}}\+: epiworld supports complex disease dynamics, including the evolution of the disease over time. For instance, diseases can accumulate mutations.

{\bfseries{Open-\/source}}\+: With funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \mbox{[}CDC\mbox{]}, epiworld is open-\/source and available under the MIT license, meaning it is entirely free. The source code is available on \href{https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/epiworld}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub}}.\hypertarget{md_paper_paper_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysection{Example use cases}\label{md_paper_paper_autotoc_md28}
As a framework, {\ttfamily epiworld} can simulate various epidemiological scenarios. This section provides some possible use cases for the package\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Geographically informed models}}\+: With the ability to model complex interactions between agents, the library can simulate geographically informed models featuring multiple regions with different populations and individuals moving between regions.
\item {\bfseries{Non-\/pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)}}\+: The library has been used to simulate NPIs featuring masking and social distancing. Furthermore, its architecture allows for deploying interventions that are reactive to the model’s state, such as a mask mandate that only activates when the prevalence of the disease reaches a certain threshold.
\item {\bfseries{Vaccination strategies}}\+: The library can simulate different vaccination strategies, including prioritizing certain groups for vaccination, varying the vaccination rate, and modeling the impact of vaccine hesitancy.
\item {\bfseries{Disease evolution}}\+: The library can simulate the evolution of the disease over time, including the emergence of new variants and the impact of these variants on the spread of the disease.
\item {\bfseries{Population comorbidities}}\+: The library can model the impact of population comorbidities on the spread of the disease, including how different comorbidities affect the transmission and severity of the disease.

The following code snippet shows a simple example of how to use epiworld to simulate an epidemic, particularly the Susceptible-\/\+Infected-\/\+Recovered model \mbox{[}SIR\mbox{]}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#include "{}epiworld.hpp"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{using namespace epiworld;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{int main()}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // epiworld already comes with a couple}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // of models, like the SIR}
\DoxyCodeLine{    epimodels::ModelSIR<> hello(}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "{}COVID-\/19"{}, // Name of the virus}
\DoxyCodeLine{        0.01,        // Initial prevalence}
\DoxyCodeLine{        0.9,        // Transmission probability}
\DoxyCodeLine{        0.3         // Recovery probability}
\DoxyCodeLine{        );}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // We can simulate agents using a small-\/world network}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // with 100,000 individuals, in this case}
\DoxyCodeLine{    hello.agents\_smallworld(100000, 4L, false, .01);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // Running the model and printing the results}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // Setting the number of days (100) and seed (122)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    hello.run(100, 122);}
\DoxyCodeLine{    hello.print();}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    return 0;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


The output could look something like the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_}
