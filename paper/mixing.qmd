We will look into the probability of drawing infected individuals to simplify the algorithm. There are $I$ infected individuals at any time in the simulation; thus, instead of drawing from $Bern(c/N, N)$, we will be drawing from $Bern(c/N, I)$. The next step is to check which infected individuals should be drawn. Let's compare the distributions using the hypergeometric as an example:


```{r}
#| label: Simulation
set.seed(132)
nsims <- 1e5
N <- 400
rate <- 2
p <- rate/N
I <- 10

sim_complex <- parallel::mclapply(1:nsims, \(i) {
  nsamples <- rbinom(N, N, p)
  sum(rhyper(N, m = I, n = N, k = nsamples) > 0)
}, mc.cores = 4L) |> unlist()

sim_simple <- parallel::mclapply(1:nsims, \(i) {
  sum(rbinom(N, I, p) > 0) 
}, mc.cores = 4L) |> unlist()


op <- par(mfrow = c(1,2))
MASS::truehist(sim_complex)
MASS::truehist(sim_simple)
par(op)

quantile(sim_complex)
quantile(sim_simple)
```

These two approaches are equivalent, but the second one is more efficient from the computational perspective.
